# odin-recipes
This is a project where I'm going to develop a recipes website using the skills learned thanks to The Odin Project.

This website will include the following information:
- Title
- Headers
- Text (including paragraphs)
- Images
- Links to external and internal websites

My current setup is:
- HP Spectre x360 (Intel i7 8th gen, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB NVMe SSD)
- Windows 11 Pro
- Ubuntu installed in Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Git (Ubuntu)
- Visual Studio Code (Windows 11)

Great project as a proof of concept where I'm going to show my progress.
