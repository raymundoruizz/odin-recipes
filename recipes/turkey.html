                smaller than 12 pounds.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turkey: This recipe calls for a whole 12-pound turkey. 
                        If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust your cooking time.</li>
                    <li>Seasonings: The turkey is simply seasoned with just salt and pepper, 
                        which allows the natural flavors to shine.</li>
                    <li>Flour: Two tablespoons of flour keep the bag from bursting and help with browning.</li>
                    <li>Vegetables: The turkey is roasted alongside onions and celery. 
                        For an extra pop of color, add carrots.</li>
                    <li>Turkey Bag: You should be able to find turkey-sized oven bags at your 
                        local grocery store, likely in the aluminum foil and plastic wrap aisle.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the Turkey: Remove and discard the giblets, pat the turkey dry, 
                        and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Pack the Bag: Sprinkle the bottom of the bag with flour. 
                        Place the turkey in the bag along with cut celery and onions. 
                        Seal the bag, transfer to a roasting pan, and use a fork to poke several holes in the bag.</li>
                    <li>Roast the Turkey: Bake in a preheated oven until the juices run clear. 
                        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh meat should read 180 degrees F.</li>
                </ol>
                    <h3>Don't forget: A 12-pound turkey should be fully cooked (using this bag method) after about 3 to 3.5 hours in a 350 degrees F oven.</h3>
